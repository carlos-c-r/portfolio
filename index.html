            <h1>ENDWI</h1>
            <h2>2018, ENDWI New Mexico</h2>
            <h3>Technical Direction, Shader programming, C++ Programming, Unreal Engine</h3>
            <p>
                ENDWI is an immersive story depicting the perception, results and consequences of drunk driving, with
                state
                of the art 3D motion capture provided by Microsoft and top of the line graphical fidelity.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge of this project was twofold. First, attempting to reach an astounding level of
                graphic
                detail, which was paramount to correctly showcase the 3D capturing tech and make the experience truly
                immersive -all this while not requiring anything higher than a top end consumer GPU, or reasonable
                amounts
                of RAM.
                Also, we had to deal with several unexpected issues with the 3D capture playback plugin that caused
                crashes
                on UE.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                My input towards this project relied mainly on the following aspects:
                - Hyperaggresive profiling and optimization of assets to maximize realism while maintaining performance
                budget and the required framerate for VR.
                - Development of practical VFX through custom shaders.
                - Manual tweaks and recompilation of engine code to accomodate the 3D plugin issues
                - Coordination of the design, modeling and animation team.

                CMC is Cupra's worldwide convention, held, for the first time, due to COVID-19, 100% digitally through
                an
                immersive, interactive and multiuser environment, along with activities and challenges for participants
                to
                engage in.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                This project posed an enormous challenge in terms of logistics and infrastructure, requiring the
                coordination of a large amount of interconnected resources, as well as aggresive optimization strategies
                to
                ensure decent performance on the best range of PCs possible, which was aggravated by the fact we were
                deploying to the web, and not standalone binaries.
                It was also a live event, meaning we had to handle any issues also at real time, or risk completely
                halting
                the event.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                My input towards this project relied mainly on the following aspects:
                - Hyperaggresive optimization of assets to meet memory and performance requirements of a web release,
                with
                lower end target PCs.
                - Development of several model and asset pipelines to optimize assets through Blender automatization.
                - Complete oversight of netcode stacks to ensure maximum number of clients per shard.
                - Development of ad-hoc support services for client communications, distribution and control.
                - Complete oversight of cloud architecture, cost analysis and risk prediction for all needed resources.
                - Live coordination with several teams, both on and off site, during the actual event.

                This is the result of World Bank's collaboration with the Chinese government to celebrate their
                partnership's anniversary through a web-based 360 experience, developed with Unreal Engine.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                This project posed a challenge, as in this year, Unity wasn't quite to par with Unreal Engine for
                desired
                graphic quality, thus forcing adoption of UE, yet Epic having just dropped HTML5 build support.
                This forced us to rely on oder versions of UE, with community-driven build plugins.
                We also faced big issues with load times and memory optimization, as the client wished the highest
                fidelity
                while keeping load times low.
                Finally, there were challenges with the interactivity, as they desired the cards content in the
                experience
                to be dynamic.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>

                with
                lower end target PCs.
                - Development of a 100% custom build and deploy process, both in UE side and web side, allowing for
                runtime
                loading of external .pak files in the web, used to keep load times as short and sparse possible by doing
                lazy loading.
                - Development of practical VFX through shaders.
                - Development of a custom pipeline to manage content through a CMS and its consumption inside the
                experience.

            <h3>Android programming, Mixed reality, Hardware setup, Live event hosting.</h3>
            <p>
                We were invited by Red Bull to the BC One 2017 breakdancing world cup at Nagoya, Japan, to set up and
                operate several custom immersive stands where people could paint in VR in a custom tiltbrush scenario
                with a
                3D sculpture of the world cup, and have photos of them taken while doing so, getting mixed into the 3D
                space, and sent to them.
                Partners Paraddax brought their holographic technology to make the experience really stand out too!.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The biggest and most obvious. We had to attend two venues, and we only had one translator. Somehow my
                Japanese was enough to get what we needed done.
                On the tech side, the main challenge was dealing with integrating the mixed reality pipeline, which we
                couldn't do on the tablets themselves, since it took way too much power, and we didn't have chargers for
                them, and needed a long battery life to last through the event.
                We also faced trouble with setting up our 4G routers for the desired connectivity through Japan's
                telecom
                systems.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                My input towards this project relied mainly on the following aspects:
                - Being live host to the stands.
                - Solving the internet connectivity issues under pressure.
                - Developing the custom OpenCV pipeline to handle mixed reality.

                This project involved a 3d body scan platform, which would be sent to a software that would take your
                measurements automatically in order to show you your best fit.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                Dealing with the variability of human anatomy was the biggest challenge. I had to compensate for any
                shortcomings of the 3d scan too.
                There was also the fact that I had absolutely no clue about tailoring and measurements.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                - Accelerated crash course on tailoring and measurement (thanks, Mom!)
                - Implementation of a PCA analysis routine to ensure alignment of scanned models (this was a shortcoming
                of
                the scanner).
                - Implementation of the analysis tool in C++ that would obtain the reference points and measures through
                OpenCV.
                - Developing the viewer in Unity that would display said points and measurements interactively.

            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The main challenge was of course correctly handling the required domain knowledge for such an
                application,
                as the bonding rules for covalent bonds are not exactly systematic and there are a lot of corner cases.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                - My background in physics (which included some chemistry too) allowed me to efficiently interact with
                the
                client to solve all corner cases and bring the project to success within the very limited budget.

            <h3>Shader programming, C# Programming, Unity, OpenCV, C++ programming, Python programming, Embedded programming.</h3>
            <p>
                A commissioned project to develop an interactive ping pong table with bespoke games through scanning and detection technologies.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                This project was an absolute challenge.
                Not only was it the first project I solved while working from home (when it required heavy amounts of in-office presence).
                Also, we had absolutely no control over the conditions and capabilities of the actual live setup, making it really hard to establish acceptance criteria.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                - My background in physics helped immensely to both geometric calculations as well as signal processing calculations.
                - Had to devise a very flexible and configurable detection mechanism, so we could cope with uncertain conditions on site based on only minimal on-site testing.
                - Was my first big WFH project, when i didn't have the testing setup at home. Forced me to develop a replay system that allowed to test the project from previously recorded data, which became a staple for future projects.

            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                - Brand new library at the time. required several iterations to accomodate to our usual use cases.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                - Heavy trial and error to ensure resulting codegen was compilable and applicable. Ended providing invaluable time savings on our frequent native lib integrations.

                VR back in the day, that being Google Cardboard, and eventually, before discontinuation, Samsung GearVR
                and
                Google Daydream.
            </p>
            <h4>The challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The amount of projects coming in requiring a cardboard, gearVR or daydream solution, and the
                unavailability
                or immaturity of relevant Unity/UE plugins at the time, prompted us to develop an in-house solution.
            </p>
            <h4>The solutions</h4>
            <p>
                - Adapting, as the sole Android developer back then, to the ever changing requirements in an extensible
                way
                to keep the SDK usable.
                - Handling the idiosyncrasies of each supported platform at the time, was tricky, as there was no open
                standard like OpenXR today.

                of code.
                It was motivated by the client's platform requiring multitude of entity types with common CRUD
                operations.
                The repo explores the more metaprogramming side of TS's compilation and transpilation process, as well
                as an
                in-depth reverse engineering of the mechanisms of Nest JS and TypeORM.
